Make Me Rich Calculation Worksheet

One cannot effectively write code without knowing the algorithm first. 
The objective of this worksheet is to have you think critically about 
your Make Me Rich algorithm, write it out, and test it out by hand 
calculations. I do not recommend writing the code (yet), this is about 
knowing the logic and formulas to generate the calculations.

Use this text file as a template for your work. 

==========================
Part I: Name all variables
==========================

1) Name of each of the input variables

a. startingAge
b. retirementAge
c. startingSalary
d. annualSavings
e. annualRaise
f. interestRate

2) Name each of the Summary Output Variables:

a. totalYearsToInvest
b. retirementFund
c. lifetimeSalary
d. totalSaved
e. earnedInterest

3) Name each of the current year's Detail Output Variables

a. currentAge
b. salary
c. savings
d. interest
e. retirement

4) Any other variables you need (optional)

a. totalRetirement
b. totalInterest
c. totalSavings






====================
Part II: Pseudocode:
====================

Write out your logic and formula's to calculate both the detail
and summary values in terms of the input values. 

Include any loops (can be done with a single loop)

Recommendation: Calculate the detail table values for each year, 
and accumulate totals for the summary table as you go, 
at the end of your loop, print the summary table. 

Do not worry that the requirement is to show the summary table first, 
and the detail table below it, the order of the tables is handled by 
HTML/CSS. This is just the logic for your JavaScript. 

Ensure you have calculations for each and every one of your 
detail variables and summary variables

Here is something to get you started:

yearsToInvest = retirementAge - startingAge;

console.log("Age  Salary  Savings  Interest  Retirement");

for (let year = startingAge; year <= retirementAge; year++) {
  currentSalary = currentSalary * annualRaisePercent + currentSalary;

  if (year == startingAge) {
    currentSalary = startingSalary;
  }

  currentSavings = currentSalary * annualSavingsPercent;

  totalSavings = currentSavings + totalSavings;

  totalRetirement = totalRetirement + currentSavings + interest;

  interest = totalRetirement * interestRate;
  totalInterest = totalInterest + interest;

  retirement = totalSavings + totalInterest;

  console.log(
    year,
    currentSalary.toFixed(0),
    currentSavings.toFixed(0),
    interest.toFixed(0),
    retirement.toFixed(0)
  );

  lifetimeSalary = currentSalary + lifetimeSalary;
}

console.log(yearsToInvest.toFixed(0), ": Years to invest");
console.log(retirement.toFixed(0), ": Retirement Fund");
console.log(lifetimeSalary.toFixed(0), ": Lifetime Salary");
console.log(totalSavings.toFixed(0), ": Total Saved");
console.log(totalInterest.toFixed(0), ": Earned Interest");











============================================
Part III: First 5 Years Calculations by hand
============================================

Use you algorithm and logic above to calculate the following scenario:

Starting Age:        25
Retirement Age:      30
Starting Salary: 50,000
Annual Savings:     10%
Annual Raise:        1%
Interest Rate:       5%

Age      Salary      Savings       Interest    Retirement
======== =========== ============= =========== ==============
25       50,000      5,000         250         5,250
26       50,500      5,050         515         10,815
27       51,005      5,101         796         16,711
28       51,515      5,152         1,093       22,956
29       52,030      5,203         1,408       29,567
30       52,551      5,255         1,741       36,563

Years to invest: 5
Retirement Fund: 36,563
Lifetime Salary: 307,601
Total Saved.   : 30,760
Earned Interest: 5,803




Answer Key to check your algorithm (note: there are two mistakes)

Age      Salary      Savings       Interest    Retirement
======== =========== ============= =========== ==============
25            50,000         5,000         250          5,250
26            50,500         5,050         515         10,815
27            51,005         5,101         796         16,711
28            51,515         5,152       1,093         22,956
29            52,030         5,203       1,508         29,567
30            52,551         5,255       1,741         36,563

Years to invest:       5
Retirement Fund:  36,563 
Lifetime Salary: 307,601
Total Saved.   :  30,760
Earned Interest:   6,803


What is error 1 in the detail table: 
    column and age: Interest @ 29
    correct value:  1,408

What is error 2 in the summary table:
    Row Label:      Earned Interest
    Correct Value:  5,803
